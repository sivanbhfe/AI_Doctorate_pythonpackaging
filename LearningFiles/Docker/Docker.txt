# Pull and image from docker hub
	docker run -d -P --name catgif manifoldailearning/catgif
# -d : Short for --detach. This runs the container in the background (detached mode), so your terminal doesn't get blocked.
# -P : Short for --publish-all. It tells Docker to randomly map all exposed container ports to available ports on the host.
For example, if the container exposes port 80, Docker might map it to port 49153 on the host.
# --name catgif : Assigns a name to your container: catgif. This makes it easier to reference the container later (e.g., docker stop catgif).
# manifoldailearning/catgif : This is the Docker image being used to create the container. It comes from Docker Hub and likely contains a web service or app related to cat GIFs.


# Get port where container is running (this returns your OS port not the actual container port exposed)
	docker port catgif
# To run container on specific port in your OS
	docker run -p 8888:5000 --name catgif manifoldailearning/catgif
# This will run 5000 port of container in 8888 port of your Host OS
