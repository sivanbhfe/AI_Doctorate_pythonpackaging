#For packaging #Key considerations
requirements.txt # In main package folder - to list all dependencies and give a way to easily install all at one go
MANIFEST.in # In main package folder - To list which folders/files to include and exclude (similar function like "gitignore" file)
README.me # In main package folder - To give instructions to install and use the package
VERSION # In 1 level sub main package folder - To mention version number
__init.py__ # In 1 level sub main package folder same as VERSION file - To read VERSION number from VERSION file and make it available for setup.py in main package folder

Primary folder
	__init__.py
	setup.py
	Subfolder1
		__init__.py
		other py files
	Subfolder2
		__init__.py
		other py files
		
		
#Instructions:
terminal -> python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
# to install all from requirements.txt
terminal -> pip install -r .\requirements.txt
# to auto create requirements.txt file in current folder
terminal ->  pip freeze > requirements.txt

#create new virtual environment
terminal -> virturalenv ml_package

#sdist creates .tar.gz file containing all files necessary for someone to run set-up again. Contains all sources files .py, readme, including setup.py
# bdist_wheel creates wheel file is the binary distribution, faster installation does not include all source files


#Alternate Instructions:
terminal -> pip install build
terminal -> python -m build

does all the work of python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel in one simple comman


### Install twine
terminal -> python setup.py sdist # to create package
terminal -> twine upload --verbose --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ .\dist\siva_unique_10456-0.1.tar.gz # to upload package to pypi test environment
# to install your package directly from pypi test environment
terminal -> pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ siva-unique-10456==0.1 #Use exact url you get once you upload your package
